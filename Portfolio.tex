\title{Operations and Security portfolio}
\author{James McKenzie}

\maketitle
This a portfolio of work that I have completed and intend to complete in Semester 1 of 2020, as part of my work in the 
Operations and Security team in Project 2
\medskip
This semester, my primary goal is to complete some AWS certifications or some Azure certifications. Im mostly looking into the 
Operations certifications, although some of the software engineering and security ones also look pretty good. My other goal
is to get a better understanding of CI/CD and learn some CI/CD tools such as Spinnaker and Jenkins. This also gives me an opportunity
to learn more of the Rust programming language, as that is one of the rising stars in programming; Being used by both Systems administrators,
and Software developers both. I can use test programs to test my CI/CD testing


\section{Week 01}
The first week of Class is mostly uneventful, but i will document the first week,  just for the sake of completeness. 


\subsection{Class 1}

Today we mainly just set up our machines for the semester. A lot of people seemed somewhat interested in OPs, which i guess is good.
Theres talk of maybe visiting a datacenter and getting some AWS / Azure qualifications, which I am all up for

\subsection{Class 2}
Today we got all the new people into the OPs group. Seem like a good bunch. I showed them around the documentation, got some of them added
into the gitlab documentation repo, and gave a rough overview on what we actually do in the ops department, re: keeping gitlab open, and helping
other projects with any servers or CI/CD that they may need. Rob also came to bother us regarding some issues with both gitlab having certificate
errors, and the server upstairs having some problems mapping its storage. I took a little look at both of these problems, and decided that 
the git issue is more important as many lecturers use gitlab to teach their classes.


\section{Week 02}
\subsection{Class 1}
Today, as faisal and matt were absent, I held a meeting with everyone just to see what everyone is interested in. We have
a lot of people interested in networking, which is a welcome change from neither me or Matt understanding the first thing about
basic networks. It seems a fair few of them aren't overly comfortable in either Linux or Windows Server operating systems, which
I guess they will learn as they work through the Ops group. I know that I definitely want to do something regarding CI/CD as a main
project this semester, and Faisal said he would give me some software to look at in the coming days. I also ended up renewing all of
the certificates today, which took up a lot of time, as the documentation for the cert renewals is broken. There are chain files, which
I still do not understand, which do not work, but I plan to give them a shot later on this week.  It prevents people logging into gitlab
via the automatic authentication via the idp servers. 
\subsection{Class 2}
Today was spent trying to diagnose some issues regarding gitlab, that I definitely over engineered. We had a message from a student
letting me know that he could see a bunch of other repos. I spent about 4 hours trying to brute force find the cause of this, by checking
file permissions and going through pages of bug reports on google regarding this issue. I then came to my senses, and checked what repos
the student was supposed to be able to access, and then I found out that all students in his class were able to access eachothers repos, 
which seems to be the intended behaviour, so I spent the day just going on a wild goose chase looking for bugs and issues that weren't there

\section{Week 03}
\subsection{Class 1}
Today Faisal talked to me about a CI/CD program called Spinnaker, which is one of the heavy hitters in the CI/CD world. I had a look
through it today, and tried installing it on the Polytech computers. I ran into a large number of issues with the install, however, I did
manage to install a package called Spinnaker on my laptop. It was about this time that I realised i was not doing the install right, as its
supposed to be hosted on a cloud platform like AWS or Azure. I decided that I needeed to do some more research before i continued
\subsection{Class 2}
I did some of the Azure OPs certificate today, although I think we want to change to AWS, but I am sure some of the skills will be transferrable
\section{Week 04}
\subsection{Class 1}
This week faisal wanted us to get the Gitlab CI/CD working, which I gave a good attempt, although, I ran into some issues regarding
installing the runner. I also had to spend a while explaining exit codes to my other team members (explaining that all programs return
an integer to the shell, a 0 if the program ran correctly, or a positive integer if the program exited) I think i will get it working next
session though as i made a breakthrough with the gitlab runner.
\subsection{Class 2}
Today I got the gitlab runner working, turns out most of my issues were due to saving the gitlab runner into a drive that wasnt the 
root drive (in this case C:/) and it didn't have access to the \$PATH for some reason or another. I then ran into the problem that my program
would only ever return a success state, however, I fixed this by realising i am not as good at Python as i had expected. I then got bothered
my Rob to try and fix the IDP certificates, so I did some more research on how Chain Files work, But I will try fix this next time I come in
\section{Week 05}
\subsection{Class 1}
So today i "Fixed" the IDP situation through some very roundabout methods, although, IDP is still refusing to work with the gitlab server, I
think this is still an issue with chain files, as I don't really know what certs I am supposed to chain together due to lack of documentation.
The cert generation scripts on the servers are also binaries and not interpreted source code, for whatever reason, which means I have absolutely
no way of determining how to set up the chain files. Thankfully, we are planning to retire the gitlab service soon, and this won't be a problem
again, but I asked a few people in the OPs group if they could have a look at it at some point when they have time, as maybe between us all, 
one of us may be able to crack this problem.
\subsection{Class 2}
Personal Challenge Day! I managed to brick my laptop which had a large number of private keys that I need to access my personal servers.
So I spent today utilising different methods to get the data off my laptop. A big issue is that I encrypt my data at an operating system
level, which meant I needed to use my decrypting programs to get the data back. I achieved this by using a Live USB of Arch Linux (which
coincidentally, is the Operating System that was on my latop), to set up a environment in ram, to mount my drives, do a decrypt on those
mount points, and then change the root into the original root of my operating system. The issue seemed to be that my boot partition seemed
to have had its sector go bad, So, i threw another HDD into my laptop, and will reinstall Arch Linux at some point in the future. While
this was an odd thing to do in an OPs class, I learnt a fair amount regarding how to use Live USBs to influence a system. I might look
for a way to store keys aswell, so that this doesn't happen again, although that might be a pain, considering the sensitive nature of private
keys.
\section{Week 06}
\subsection{Class 1}
There was a big talk about potentially working from home soon, as well as a ticket that came in from the Media Analytics team, who
wanted us to look for a solution to a visitor counter program for their project for when it goes live sometime this year. I had a little
look around, but it seemed that most sites used a backend database to handle that, rather than an independant software solution. They
said they would appreciate it if i keeped looking into it.
\subsection{Class 2}
With this Covid 19 Stuff getting somewhat serious, I spent all of today making sure I have the required Keys, and files so I can continue 
working from home. I also fiddled around a little bit trying to get my AWS docker linking to work, although, I didn't have much luck, as 
instead of it giving me a command, It gave me a key? I should probably sort this out after the break
\section{Week 07}
\subsection{Class 1}
I spent today at home, working through some AWS setup. It is still an absolute hell to setup, with paths and conflicting docker instructions, 
as well as multiple verions of the AWS terminal. I think I will work more on this later, as it is giving me a hell of a headache. Unfortunately
i cannot progress to doing more stuff with Spinnaker, as i need an AWS setup to do so.
\subsection*{MidSemBreak}
Over the Midsemester break, I worked on a website, https://staging.james-mckenzie.tech/ For this, I used an online CI/CD solution,
called zeit, using a github bot called now. I mainly am doing this to get a better understanding of development workflow, and also so I
have a portfolio of work for when I go out into the workforce and start looking for work.
\subsection{Class 2}
We are finally back from break! While its been fun, Im glad to get back into the swing of things. Today I had a chat to
Amazon in regard to my account being locked for some reason. It turns out I had locked myself out of my account due to a number
of unfortunate typos. Lets hope I can make some progress faster in the coming weeks, as i really need to complete my Spinnaker setup,
as well as getting my AWS OPs certification. 

\section{Week 08}
Unfortunately, Due to working at the hospital, and a handful of classwork, I was unable to complete any OPs work this week. 
\section{Week 09}
\subsection {Class 1}
Today I decided I should try to make some further progress on the gitlab pages not working. I had a little prod around and discovered that
the apache instance for the gitlab pages was not working. It took me a handful of attempts, but I managed to get the gitlab pages back 
online, probably after around 4 hours of work. It is hard doing work in lockdown, and it's quite strange not having access to all the materials
and keys as readily as I do while in the classroom, but i guess i should try and make the best of it!
\section{Week 10}
\subsection{Class 1}
Today Cartur came up to me, and asked me what I knew about the IDP server. As I had previously wressled with the IDP server in order to get
gitlab back online, I decided I could try an point him to some files on the Gitlab server that helped me get a basic understanding of IDP. We had 
a sitdown and discussed the alternatives to using IDP, as I have found it to be too unwieldy in regards to using it; Although in heinsight, that
may stem from my endless frustration with lack of documentation of the IDP system with the gitlab server.
\subsection{Class 2}
Today I tried to continue to do some of my AWS certification, but I still was having issues getting my docker account linked to my AWS account. So instead
of wresseling with it for another hour or two, I decided to use the free Digital Ocean credit given to me from github student to create a 5 dollars per month server
and to set up some administration programs on it, and have it talk to my other server. I decided to try and work out how chef works, as well as setting up
nagios, which I have a small understanding of, due to the Systems administration paper. I managed to get nagios working somewhat smoothly, although I had some
big issues working out how Chef works, mainly due to some documnetation being a little hard to read and digest. I might have to wait until we can go back
to class before I get my AWS setup because nothing seems to be working right for me with it.

\section{Week 11}
\subsection{Class 1}
Today I talked to the rest of my group RE the servers, in order to try and figure out who I should teach to manage the certificates next semester. It seemed that
Scott was very interested in this (He replied a day later) So we decided we will try to sort the certs out on Thursday. Im a little worried at the majority of 
the groups silence on these issues, as the documentation for doing the certs doesn't seem to be currently correct, and i would rather not have to spend a lot of 
time trying to fix certbot at the end of the semester, so instead I want to opt in to doing a manual certification system, as this would allow more people to get 
hands on experience in how certification works.

\subsection{Class 2}
Today scott and I were going to work on the certificates, although I felt quite ill today and cancelled on him. I instead did some research into web assembly, as I 
want to make a personal project in the future that emulates an enigma machine, although I want it to be portable, which leaves me with 2 options, either I write
it in web assembly, or I write it in Java/Python. 

\section{Week 12}
\subsection{Class 1}
Today I recieved a teams message from Yan Dong in the machine learning team, informing me of some problems with Pop OS's package management. She was habving trouble 
installing some of the packages that she needed to move on to the next stage in her project. I had a poke around but I couldn't figure out a solution. I asked Matt
to give it another lookover for me, as he also knows his way around linux package managers quite well, and neither of us could determine the problem. I will look
for solutions over the coming days, as potentially it may be an issue for other PopOS users, and maybe one of them can provide us with a fix.

\subsection{Class 2}
A fix was found on this day. After doing some gogling, and nearly giving up hope, I read a stackoverflow post that was a few years old, of a similar error on
Ubuntu. It said that I needed to add more sources to the sources list file. I used this command (sudo sed -ie 's|eoan|disco|g' /etc/apt/sources.list) and I manged to
fix the dependancy problem. Ofcourse before i did this, I read the majority of the SED manpage so i knew more or less what I was doing.
